# test-maven-lifecycle
This is a test script to test git branching model with mercurial and the Maven lifecycle

This project attempts to replicate the git feature branching model as found herehttp://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" 

More importantly this project is attempting to use Maven to introduce the git branching model.

## Install
* Simply clone the project:
   git clone https://github.com/zwi/test-maven-lifecycle.git
* Make sure you have Mercurial installed
* If you're interested in playing with Maven make sure it's installed too

## Getting Started
* make hg
  This will create a new project called hg.test and do a bunch of branching and commits. This SHOULD look very similar to the git branching module described above
* make maven
  This will create a new project called my-app and do Maveny things
